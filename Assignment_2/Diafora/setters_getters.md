**Encapsulation**, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users.

If you want others to **read** or **modify** the value of a **private** member, you can provide public get and set methods.

With data hiding, you can write code that checks the data coming into a class to make sure it is **valid** **before assigning** it to member variables. A data validating function can stop illegal values from entering the object and preserving the integrity of the data.

After installing libx11-dev to solve the header problems (#include <X11/Xlib.h> etc), I had to install fltk1.3.
After that, there was an ""Window" is ambiguous in Xlib.h" solved by following the instructions from stackoverflow related to namespace in Graph_lib.
After that there was no compiling error. BUT, there was a segmentation fault related to  a function find_best_font() that went back to a library libX11.so.6 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6
Thankfully, the solution came after installing libxft-dev that is related to (f@ck!ng) fonts. FONTS!!!!!

- sudo apt-get install libxft-dev (https://zoomadmin.com/HowToInstall/UbuntuPackage/libxft-dev)

- sudo apt-get install fltk1.3

Errors
#include <X11/Xlib.h> etc
- "Window" is ambiguous in Xlib.h (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15606097/stroupstrup-graphics-library-errors)
- XLoadQueryFont
- find_best_font()
- Could not load source './string/../sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/strlen-avx2.S': 'SourceRequest' not supported..

To solve these issues I spent about ~ 5-6 hours visit more than 50 links.
Apart from the god-sent links above, the following links where also useful in trying to understand the origin of the problems:

- TAKE CARE OF EXCEPTIONS
- DOCUMENTATION of every function!!!!

- In night_phase RENAME the error classes and generally choose better names.
- In night_phase put the while(1) loops in a separate function, same as voting_system.

- voting_system.cpp Make all the shits of while(1) one single function.

My files were very messy. Testing was very hard.
There were many inconsistencies especially in 
player's number and player's index.
I try to make things more clear.


- Create game_flow.cpp
- Create town_of_salem.h.

---- IN EVERY FILES ----
- Define DOC, GANG, CIT, LOSER.
- Rename Player's number --> Player's id.
- Delete all error classes and replace them with the error() function 
included in std_lib_facilities.h. Now all exceptions are runtime_errors.

- initialization.cpp
 Changed some function documentation.

- info_menu.cpp
 - In show_options() change the text to something more minimal.
   Also, put the menu in a single line.
 - Replace the four print functions with a single function print_request().
 - In info_menu() clean the input buffer when error occurs. 
   This is needed when a non-int number is given.
 - Change dashed_line() to use std::string().
 
- night_phase.cpp
 - Change dashed_line(). Same as info_menu.cpp
 - Rename read_player_number() --> get_player_id().
   In get_player_id() delete the error relating to vote_himself_error.
 - Create get_doctor_save() to read the id of the player chosen by the doctor.
   It calls get_player_id(). It handles the case that the doctor chose to save
   himself.
 - Handle the case that there is no doctor available. In that case, the player
   chosen by the gangster leaves. Nobody can save him.

- voting_day_phase (previous voting_system.cpp)
 - Delete error classes.
 - Change comments, and function documentation.
 - Change in_vector() to use for-each loop.
 - Replace get_player_number with get_player_id(). Same as night_phase.cpp.
 - Delete dashed_line().
 - Add dashed_message().
 - Add day_phase().

- ./GUI/ and ./fltk-1.3.5/ are the same as the example of chapter 12 uploaded on elearn.
  (To avoid fltk examples from compiling, we comment the three lines after the comment 
  #build examples... inside ./fltk-1.3.5/CMakeLists.txt)

- ./Assignment_3/ contains the files for our single round game.
  Code for assignment 3 is inside ./Assignment_3/Game_window.h,
  ./Assignment_3/Game_window.cpp and ./Assignment_3/Assignment__3.cpp.

- Players.txt is used to load players and roles, as we did for assignment 2.

- ./Assignment_3/Assignment_2/ contains the files we use to create a library
  that helps us resume the game after closing the game window.

- ./Assignment_3/Images_dir/ contains all the image files necessary.
